    Initialize the Frontend Project:
        Set up the project directory structure.
        Create necessary folders: public, views, css, js.
    Install Dependencies:
        Install Handlebars and any other necessary dependencies.

2. HTML and Handlebars Templates

    Main Layout:
        Create a main layout template with a basic structure (header, footer, and content area).
        Include links to CSS files and any necessary JavaScript files.

    Home Page:
        Design the home page with navigation links (e.g., Register, Login, and Dashboard).

    Register Page:
        Create a registration form template using Handlebars.
        Fields: Username, Password, Confirm Password.
        Include client-side validation messages.

    Login Page:
        Create a login form template using Handlebars.
        Fields: Username, Password.
        Include client-side validation messages.

    Dashboard Page:
        Create a protected dashboard template.
        Display a welcome message and user-specific information.
        Include a logout button.

3. CSS Styling

    Global Styles:
        Set up global styles for consistent look and feel.
        Define styles for header, footer, forms, buttons, and general layout.

    Page-specific Styles:
        Style the registration, login, and dashboard pages.
        Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes.

4. JavaScript (Frontend Logic)

    Form Handling:
        Add client-side form validation for registration and login forms.
        Handle form submissions using Fetch API or Axios to interact with the backend.

    User Authentication:
        Store JWT token in localStorage or sessionStorage after successful login.
        Use the token to authenticate protected routes and manage user sessions.

    Logout Functionality:
        Implement logout logic to clear the JWT token and redirect to the login page.

5. Integration with Backend

    Registration Integration:
        Connect the registration form to the backend API to create a new user.
        Handle success and error responses from the server.

    Login Integration:
        Connect the login form to the backend API to authenticate the user.
        Store the received JWT token and handle navigation to the dashboard.

    Protected Routes:
        Ensure the dashboard page and any other protected routes are accessible only to authenticated users.
        Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

6. Testing and Debugging

    Manual Testing:
        Test all forms and interactions using various scenarios to ensure correct functionality.
        Test the responsiveness and design on different devices and browsers.

    Bug Fixing:
        Identify and fix any issues found during manual testing.
        Refactor code for readability and maintainability.

7. Optional Enhancements

    Enhanced Validation:
        Implement more complex client-side validations (e.g., password strength, email format).

    User Roles and Permissions:
        Add support for different user roles (e.g., admin, user) and protect routes accordingly.

    Persistent User Session:
        Implement token refresh logic to maintain user sessions without requiring frequent logins.
