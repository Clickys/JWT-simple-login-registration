    Setup Express App:
        Initialize the Express app.
        Use body-parser middleware for parsing JSON request bodies.
        Use the auth routes.
        Handle any global error handling or 404 responses as necessary.

    Start the Server:
        Import the app and start the server on the specified port.
        Connect to the MongoDB database using Mongoose before starting the server.

Example Workflow:

    Configuration:
        Load environment variables for configuration settings (port, JWT secret, MongoDB URI).

    User Model:
        Define a Mongoose schema for the user model with fields for username and password.
        Create and export the user model.

    Auth Controller:
        Register route:
            Validate the incoming request data. -> completed
            Check for existing username. -> completed
            Hash the password and save the user. -> completed
            Return a success response. -> completed
         Login route:
            Validate the incoming request data. -> completed
            Verify the username and password. -> completed
            Generate and return a JWT token. -> completed

    Auth Middleware:
        Middleware to authenticate requests using JWT. -> completed
        Extract and verify the token. -> completed
        Attach user data to the request object. -> completed

    Auth Routes:
        Create routes for user registration, login, and a protected route. -> completed
        Use the authentication middleware to protect routes. -> completed

Testing the Project:

    Use tools like Postman or curl to:
        Register a new user. - > completed
        Log in with the registered user to get a JWT token. -> completed
        Access the protected route using the JWT token in the Authorization header. --> completed

Enhancements (Optional):

    Add more complex validations (e.g., using express-validator).
    Implement persistent storage using a database (e.g., MongoDB).
    Add user roles and permissions.
